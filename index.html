It is the strength that allows us to bounce back and adapt in the face of challenges, trauma, or hardship.

It is an essential quality that empowers us to find meaning and purpose even in the most difficult circumstances. Resilient individuals possess a sense of optimism, perseverance, and emotional agility, which enables them to overcome obstacles and emerge stronger on the other side. By cultivating resilience, we can transform adversity into an opportunity for growth and build a more resilient and compassionate world.</p>
